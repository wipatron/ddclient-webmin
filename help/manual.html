<header>Manual IP Update Help</header>
<p>
There are five main tabs which serve to group the Manual IP Update options by function.
Each option has an explanation to the right.  For more information, click on "Search Docs" to the top right of the screen.
<p>
The basic operation of the Manual IP Update function is as follows:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Configuration Tabs</b>
<br>Configure the parameters in each of the four tabs as desired.  An explanation of the tabs is shown below.
</li>
<li>
<b>Build Button</b>
<br>Click on the "Build" button to transfer the values you have chosen from the configuration tabs into the command line edit box.
</li>
<li>
<b>Manual Edits</b>
<br>You can, at any time, manually edit the command line parameters.
</li>
<li>
<b>Test Button</b>
<br>You can now click on the "Test" button to see if the parameters you have so far entered into the command line,
either through manual edits, or using the configuration tabs and clicking on "Build", will work.  ddclient is invoked, 
but with the "-noexec", "-verbose", and "-debug" modes enabled.  No action will take place, and you will have a chance 
to diagnose any problems.
</li>
<li>
<b>Run Button</b>
<br>When you click on the "Run" button, any parameters currently in the command line edit box are run against the ddclient command.  
Output is shown immediately below the screen.
</li>
<li>
<b>Save Button</b>
<br>Once you have a good working set of command line parameters, you can click "save" to save them to a seperate configuration file for future use.
</li>
<li>
<b>Previous Button</b>
<br>Use this button if you want to retrieve the previous set of parameters.
</li>
</ul>
