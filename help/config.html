<header>Config File Help</header>	
<p>
There are five main tabs which serve to group the config file options by function.
Each option has an explanation to the right.  For more information, click on "Search Docs" to the top right of the screen.
<ul>
<li>
<b>Basic Daemon</b>
<br>Common options
</li>
<li>
<b>Advanced Daemon</b>
<br>System related functions pertaining to the operation of ddclient.
</li>
<li>
<b>Servers/Protocols</b>
<br>Select the desired protocol from the dropdown menu.  
You must then click the "Protocol" button for the options pertinent to that protocol to appear.
Note that each protocol has its own specific set of options.
Every selection must, however, always include the "server", "login", and "password" options to be filled in.
</li>
<li>
<b>Routers/IP Acquisition</b>
<br>This tab contains options specific to the method by which your local ddclient will obtain its IP address information.
Use the dropdown menu next to "use" to choose this option.  Next click on the "Use" button to process your choice.
The module will then present you with sub-options specific to the method chosen.
</li>
<li>
<b>/etc/default Options</b>
<br>This tab contains information which is typically only contained in the /etc/default/ddclient file.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are three buttons used in the Config File maintenance:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Previous</b>
<br>Use this button if you need to retrieve the previous set of config files (created before you execute any save).
</li>
<li>
<b>Update</b>
<br>Use this button to write changes to the /etc/ddclient.conf and /etc/default/ddclient files.  
A validation will first take place, identifying any errors detected.  If an error is detected, the files will not be written.
</li>
<li>
<b>Validate</b>
<br>This is a safe option which makes no changes.  It only validates the options you've chosen so far, 
and then displays below what the configuration file would look like if written.  Also, any errors detected are displayed.
</li>
</ul>
